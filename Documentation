stream.py is the main class which contains filters and stuff
stream uses the included tweepy package.
tweepy needs to be installed TODO: include instalation files

To get OAuth keys:
-to go https://dev.twitter.com/apps
-login and register TODO: how do I pass this off to someone else?
-Use keys from there in the main file

Tweet is used to convert tweets to python dictionaries
-this process turns ' into ^ because ' is a quote

Listener DOES STUFF with the tweets once they appear
-I just make a tweet object and send it somewhere

Filter only allows 400 terms to filter on
if you want ALL tweets contact DataSift and Gnip for $$$
