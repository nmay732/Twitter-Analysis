Twitter-Analysis: my senior research project
============================================

How to Use:
1) Run stream.py to save tweets to a text file
  ex python stream.py ~/tweets.txt
2) Run DirMultiNomAnalysis.py on that output (or another saved output)
  ex python DirMultiNomAnalysis.py ~/tweets.txt
